Mtime — Monotonic wall-clock time for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.8.3

Mtime is an OCaml module to access monotonic wall-clock time. It
allows to measure time spans without being subject to operating system
calendar time adjustments.

Mtime depends only on your platform system library. The optional
JavaScript support depends on [js_of_ocaml][1]. It is distributed
under the BSD3 license.

## Installation

Mtime can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install mtime
    opam install js_of_ocaml mtime  # mtime with jsoo support

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][5]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the
distribution.

## Sample programs

If you installed Mtime with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var mtime:doc`.

In the distribution sample programs are located in the `test`
directory of the distribution. They can be built with:

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind test/tests.otarget

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test`.

- `test.native` tests the library, nothing should fail.
