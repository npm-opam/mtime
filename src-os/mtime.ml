(* Time spans

   In this backend time spans are in nanoseconds and we represent them
   by an unsigned 64-bit integer. This allows to represent spans for:
   (2^64-1) / 1_000_000_000 / (24 * 3600 * 365.25) ≅ 584.5 Julian years *)

type span = int64 (* unsigned nanoseconds *)

(* Passing time *)

external elapsed : unit -> span = "ocaml_mtime_elapsed_ns"
let available = elapsed () <> 0L

(* Counters *)

type counter = span
let counter = elapsed
let count c = Int64.sub (elapsed ()) c

(* Time scale conversion and pretty printers *)
